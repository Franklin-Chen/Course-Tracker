# My Personal Project

## By Franklin Chen

<ul>


- This program will allow a user to add a course with an attached instructor collection and allows the user to view the average rating of the course, and the instructor

<br>

- The demographic for this app would be useful for mostly students

- This project is of interest of me as I have had a lot of trouble selecting elective courses. I always jump in not sure of what to expect.
- I have talked about this with a few friends, and noticed that many have the same problem.
